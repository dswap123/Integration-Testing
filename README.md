Integration Testing for Fashion Cloud QA challange

This is done using mocha and chai. 
It contains three tests which are as following:

1. Get all to do items
2. Get all items from a bad api call
3. Add a new item to the list and validate the status.

I have validated the same using POSTMAN. Let me know if you have any questions.
